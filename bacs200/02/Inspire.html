            How do you become someone hero? Isiash Thomas showed people that you can do anything and everything. It doesn't matter about how tall you are or how fast or slow. He should me that if you put you're mind to it you can really, truly, do whatever you want in this world. That's how you become a hero.

            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
            <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
            <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
            
        </ul>
